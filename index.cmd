////

Conway's fence-style markdown,
implemented in Python using regex replacements.

////


////

Conway markdown (CMD) is the result of someone joking that
"the filenames would look like Windows executables from the 90s".
Inspired by the backticks of John Gruber's [markdown][],
Conway markdown uses fence-style constructs,
for which arbitrarily long runs of a delimiter symbol can be used
to avoid needing to escape that symbol.
